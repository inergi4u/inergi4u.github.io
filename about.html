    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>At Northic Roots, our story is one of resilience, determination, and a deep commitment to giving back. Founded by two dynamic women, Habiba and Salma, Northic Roots is more than just a supply chain business—it’s a testament to the power of perseverance, community, and cultural heritage.</p>
    <p>Habiba, who grew up in Montreal, overcame the unique challenges of being a visible minority while excelling in both French and English, skills that have been instrumental in shaping her journey. Salma, on the other hand, brings a story of courage and hope. Growing up in Burma, she witnessed firsthand the hardships her family faced. Her parents made the bold decision to immigrate to Canada, seeking a life of peace and opportunity. Salma embraced the values they instilled—dedication, resilience, and a desire to create a nurturing environment for her own children. She now channels these values into building a business that embodies the essence of community and opportunity while living the Canadian dream of inclusion and prosperity.</p>
    <p>Together, Habiba and Salma have built Northic Roots as a company rooted in trust, integrity, and empowerment. Beyond business, they are deeply committed to mentoring and coaching individuals who aspire to empower themselves through entrepreneurship. Their passion lies in creating opportunities for others, especially for women from diverse and Indigenous backgrounds, paving the way for a brighter and more inclusive future.</p>
    <p>At Northic Roots, we don’t just connect supply chains; we build bridges to better lives while honoring the values that bind us all.</p>
